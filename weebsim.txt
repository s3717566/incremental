weeaboo simulator

Possible concept. You have a waifu always through the game. This waifu provides a passive upgrade (or maybe an active one that can be activated every x minutes).

Possible concept 2: No more clicking, you select a genre and the game will auto increment it.
Only one at a time at the start, unlocks like dual monitors and multi genre anime.
